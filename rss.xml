            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Wild Shape-Shifting Sofa Can Be Whatever You Want It to Be</h1><p>Carlo Ratti, who founded MIT's forward-thinking Senseable City Lab, has designed a sofa called Lift-Bit. It is on display at La Triennale in Milan, where innumerable furniture-makers showcase their work in an annual design fair.
